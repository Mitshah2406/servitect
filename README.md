# Servitect

**Servitect** (Server + Architect) is a command-line tool that automates the process of setting up a Node.js server using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It creates the necessary folder structure and pre-configured files, allowing developers to focus on building their application instead of setting up boilerplate code. 

## Installation

To install Servitect using npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g servitect
```

Once installed, you can create a new MVC project by running the following command:

```bash
npx mvc-create
```

## Features

1. **MVC Folder Structure:**
   - Automatically generates the folder structure for the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
   - Creates pre-configured files for **routes**, **controllers**, and **models**.

2. **Scalability & Maintainability:**
   - Follows industry-standard best practices for scalability, maintainability, and error-handling.
   - Ensures modular and structured code that can scale with your application.

3. **Authentication APIs:**
   - Pre-configured basic **authentication APIs** for user login and registration.
   - **JWT-based authentication** is available for any actor entity, ensuring secure and stateless authorization.

4. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Generates **basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs** for any created entity, making data management easier.
   
5. **File Upload with Cloudinary:**
   - Includes support for file uploads via **Cloudinary** in just a few clicks.

6. **WhatsApp Notifications:**
   - Seamless integration with WhatsApp API for sending **notifications** directly from your Node.js application.

8. **NodeMailer Integration:**
   - Built-in support for **NodeMailer** to handle email sending with a single click.

9. **Chat Logic & APIs:**
   - Generate **chat functionality** with pre-configured database models and APIs to manage real-time messaging between users.

10. **Local LLM Integration:**
    - Easily integrate a **Local LLM (Large Language Model)** using **Langchain** and **Ollama** for advanced text processing and NLP tasks.

## Usage

1. After installation, navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```bash
    npx mvc-create
    ```

2. Servitect will generate the following folder structure:

   ```
   ├── controllers
   ├── models
   ├── routes
   ├── services
   ├── utils
   ├── config
   └── app.js
   ```

3. Customize the generated files as per your application requirements. The basic CRUD and authentication logic will already be in place for you.

4. Use the following features as needed:
    - **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication.
    - **File Uploads**: Set up Cloudinary for file uploads.
    - **WhatsApp Notifications**: Integrate and use WhatsApp API.
    - **Push Notifications**: Set up Firebase FCM.
    - **Email Service**: Configure and use NodeMailer for sending emails.
    - **Chat System**: Pre-configured chat logic for real-time conversations.
    - **LLM Integration**: Use Langchain and Ollama for integrating a local large language model.

## Example Commands

```bash
npx mvc-create entity User
```

To enable WhatsApp notifications:

```bash
npx mvc-create whatsapp-notifications
```

To integrate Firebase FCM:

```bash
npx mvc-create firebase-fcm
```

To set up NodeMailer:
